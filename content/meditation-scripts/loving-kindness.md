Welcome to this loving-kindness meditation. [pause 2s]

Find a comfortable seat. [pause 2s]

Let your eyes close gently. [pause 3s]

Take a deep breath in... [pause 2s] and release. [pause 3s]

---

Begin by bringing to mind someone who loves you unconditionally. [pause 3s]

Perhaps a grandparent, a friend, even a pet. [pause 3s]

Feel their warmth towards you. [pause 3s]

Let that feeling fill your chest. [pause 4s]

---

Now, direct that same warmth towards yourself. [pause 3s]

Silently repeat these phrases: [pause 2s]

May I be safe. [pause 3s]

May I be healthy. [pause 3s]

May I be happy. [pause 3s]

May I live with ease. [pause 4s]

---

If your mind wanders, that's okay. [pause 2s]

Gently bring it back. [pause 2s]

May I be safe. [pause 2s]

May I be healthy. [pause 2s]

May I be happy. [pause 2s]

May I live with ease. [pause 4s]

---

Now bring to mind someone you care about. [pause 3s]

Someone you'd like to send good wishes to. [pause 3s]

See their face in your mind's eye. [pause 3s]

---

Silently offer them these phrases: [pause 2s]

May you be safe. [pause 3s]

May you be healthy. [pause 3s]

May you be happy. [pause 3s]

May you live with ease. [pause 4s]

---

Now expand your circle wider. [pause 2s]

Think of someone neutral — [pause 2s]

A neighbor, a coworker, someone you pass on the street. [pause 3s]

---

May you be safe. [pause 3s]

May you be healthy. [pause 3s]

May you be happy. [pause 3s]

May you live with ease. [pause 4s]

---

Finally, expand your heart even further. [pause 3s]

Include all beings everywhere. [pause 3s]

---

May all beings be safe. [pause 3s]

May all beings be healthy. [pause 3s]

May all beings be happy. [pause 3s]

May all beings live with ease. [pause 5s]

---

Notice how you feel. [pause 3s]

Perhaps lighter, more open. [pause 3s]

Take a deep breath in... [pause 2s] and out. [pause 3s]

---

When you're ready, gently open your eyes. [pause 2s]

Carry this kindness with you today. [pause 2s]
