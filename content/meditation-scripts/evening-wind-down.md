# Evening Wind-Down Meditation (4 minutes)

**Purpose**: Release the day and prepare for restful sleep

---

Welcome to this evening wind-down. [pause 2s]

You've made it through another day. [pause 3s]

However it went, you're here now. [pause 3s]

---

Find a comfortable position. [pause 2s]

You can lie down if you'd like. [pause 2s]

Let your eyes close. [pause 3s]

---

Take a slow breath in... [pause 2s]

And a longer breath out. [pause 4s]

With each exhale, let the day begin to fall away. [pause 4s]

---

Notice your body. [pause 2s]

Where have you been holding the weight of the day? [pause 3s]

In your shoulders? [pause 2s]

Your jaw? [pause 2s]

Your mind? [pause 3s]

---

Gently scan from head to toe. [pause 3s]

As you notice tension, imagine it softening. [pause 3s]

Melting like warm wax. [pause 4s]

---

Now, bring to mind one thing from today. [pause 3s]

Something you're grateful for. [pause 3s]

Big or small. [pause 3s]

---

Maybe it was: [pause 1s]

A kind word. [pause 2s]

A moment of sunshine. [pause 2s]

A task completed. [pause 2s]

Your own resilience. [pause 4s]

---

Hold this moment in your awareness. [pause 3s]

Let gratitude fill your chest. [pause 4s]

---

Now, gently release it. [pause 3s]

You don't need to hold onto anything from today. [pause 3s]

Let it all go. [pause 4s]

---

Imagine each breath washing away the day. [pause 3s]

Inhale calm. [pause 2s]

Exhale release. [pause 3s]

Inhale peace. [pause 2s]

Exhale tension. [pause 4s]

---

Your only job right now is to rest. [pause 3s]

There's nothing to do. [pause 2s]

Nothing to fix. [pause 2s]

Nothing to figure out. [pause 4s]

---

As thoughts arise — and they will — [pause 2s]

Simply notice them. [pause 2s]

And let them float by like clouds. [pause 4s]

---

Continue breathing softly. [pause 3s]

Your body is heavy. [pause 2s]

Sinking into support. [pause 3s]

Safe and held. [pause 4s]

---

Tomorrow is a new day. [pause 3s]

But that's tomorrow. [pause 2s]

Right now, in this moment... [pause 2s]

You are exactly where you need to be. [pause 5s]

---

Rest easy. [pause 3s]

Be well. [pause 2s]
