# Stress Relief Meditation (3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Quick reset for overwhelm and stress

---

Let's take a moment together. [pause 2s]

Right now, wherever you are, you can press pause. [pause 2s]

---

If it's safe to do so, close your eyes. [pause 2s]

Or simply soften your gaze. [pause 2s]

---

First, let's acknowledge what is. [pause 2s]

You might be feeling: [pause 1s]

Overwhelmed. [pause 1s]

Anxious. [pause 1s]

Scattered. [pause 2s]

That's okay. [pause 2s]

You're not broken. [pause 2s]

You're human. [pause 3s]

---

Take the biggest breath you've taken all day. [pause 2s]

Fill your lungs completely. [pause 3s]

Hold it for a moment. [pause 2s]

Now release it all. [pause 1s]

Let it go with a sigh. [pause 3s]

---

Again. [pause 1s]

Big breath in. [pause 2s]

Hold. [pause 2s]

Release everything. [pause 3s]

---

Now let your breath return to normal. [pause 3s]

---

Bring your attention to your feet. [pause 2s]

Feel them on the ground. [pause 2s]

Press down slightly. [pause 2s]

You are here. [pause 2s]

You are grounded. [pause 3s]

---

Notice five things you can see. [pause 3s]

Four things you can touch. [pause 3s]

Three things you can hear. [pause 3s]

Two things you can smell. [pause 3s]

One thing you can taste. [pause 3s]

---

This is your anchor. [pause 2s]

Right here, right now. [pause 3s]

---

Place your hand on your chest. [pause 2s]

Feel your heartbeat. [pause 3s]

It's been beating since before you were born. [pause 2s]

It knows what to do. [pause 3s]

You can trust your body. [pause 4s]

---

Now, imagine you're standing under a waterfall. [pause 3s]

Cool, clear water washing over you. [pause 3s]

It's washing away everything you don't need. [pause 3s]

The stress. [pause 2s]

The worry. [pause 2s]

The overwhelm. [pause 3s]

All of it flowing away. [pause 4s]

---

What remains is your essential self. [pause 3s]

Calm. [pause 2s]

Clear. [pause 2s]

Capable. [pause 3s]

---

You've done hard things before. [pause 2s]

You'll do hard things again. [pause 2s]

But right now, in this breath... [pause 2s]

You're okay. [pause 4s]

---

Take one more deep breath. [pause 3s]

---

When you open your eyes, carry this clarity with you. [pause 2s]

One breath at a time. [pause 2s]

One moment at a time. [pause 2s]

You've got this. [pause 3s]
