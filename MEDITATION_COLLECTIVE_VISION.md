# Meditation App Vision

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Status:** Concept / Daily Focus Document

---

## Core Concept

A meditation & reflection app that makes daily practice inevitable through **community momentum** - not guilt, not streaks, just... people actually showing up together.

Think Open's "everyone gets prompted at once" vibe, but for meditation instead of oversharing your lunch.

---

## Visual Aesthetic

### Base Palette
- **Background:** Bone/shell white (warm, not stark)
- **Wireframes:** Black line work over everything
- **Accents:** Purple (spiritual/third-eye vibes)
- **Textures:** Jungle - organic, alive, chaotic-calm

### Effects & Feel
- Touch Designer-style generative visuals
- Animated wireframes that breathe/pulse
- Organic noise/grain over everything
- Think: Brutalist meditation temple in a rainforest

### References
- Bone/shell: warm off-white (#F5F1E8 range)
- Wireframe black: true black (#000000)
- Purple: deep/muted (#6B46C1, #7C3AED range)
- Jungle textures: ferns, vines, leaves as subtle overlays

---

## Core Features

### 1. **Join the Collective** (Main Flow)
**The Open Model:**
- App notifies everyone at the same time
- "500 people are meditating right now"
- Tap in, join the session
- See who else showed up (optional: friends, global)
- Post-session: share how it felt (1-word check-in? color? vibe?)

**Why it works:**
- FOMO that's actually healthy
- You're not meditating alone, you're part of a wave
- Removes the "should I?" decision fatigue

### 2. **Solo Mode** (Always Available)
- "Not feeling the crowd? Go your own way."
- Timer presets: 5 / 10 / 20 / 30 min
- Same visuals, no social pressure
- Option to share afterwards ("I meditated at 3am, who else was up?")

### 3. **Daily Reflection Prompt**
**The Secret Sauce:**
- One question per day, everyone gets the same one
- Examples:
  - "What are you carrying today that isn't yours?"
  - "Where did you feel most alive this week?"
  - "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"
- Share your answer or keep it private
- See community responses (anonymous or named)

**Why this matters:**
- Meditation isn't just sitting. It's processing.
- Open does this with photos. We do it with introspection.
- Makes reflection a **communal act**, not homework

### 4. **The Feed** (Community)
- Not Instagram. Not even close.
- Simple text posts: "Meditated 10 min. Felt scattered but showed up."
- Reactions: ✨ (you too) / 🙏 (grateful) / 🌊 (felt that)
- No likes. No counts. Just presence.

## What Open Does (For Reference)

Open is a social app that:
- Sends a notification at a random time each day
- You have 2 minutes to post a photo of what you're doing right now
- Everyone gets the same notification window
- Creates authentic "this is actually my life" moments
- No filters, no curation, just raw daily reality

**What we steal from this:**
- Synchronized prompts = collective energy
- Time pressure = authenticity (no overthinking)
- Community participation = habit formation
- Anti-performative = real connection

---

## User Flow (Day 1)

### Onboarding
1. "Welcome. Meditation doesn't have to be alone."
2. Choose notification time preference (or "surprise me")
3. Pick your vibe: Solo / Social / Both
4. First session: 5-minute guided intro

### Daily Experience
**Morning:**
- Notification: "🌅 200 people are meditating in 5 minutes. Join?"
- Tap → breathing exercise countdown → session begins
- Visual: pulsing wireframe jungle, your breath synced to animation
- Timer ends → "How do you feel?" (3 emoji options: 🌊 calm / ⚡ energized / 🌫️ unclear)

**Afternoon:**
- Daily reflection prompt: "What are you avoiding today?"
- Type answer (private by default, opt-in to share)
- See 3 random community responses for context

**Evening:**
- Feed: scroll community check-ins
- "Sarah meditated 10 min. First time in a month. ✨"
- React or scroll. No pressure.

## Why This Isn't Hype / Why It Lasts

### What kills meditation apps:
- Guilt streaks (missed a day = feel like shit)
- Lonely practice (hard to stay motivated alone)
- Performative spirituality (Instagram monks)
- Feature bloat (do I need a chakra quiz? no.)

### What makes this sustainable:
- **Community momentum** - you show up because others are showing up
- **Low friction** - notification → tap → done
- **No judgment** - missed 5 days? next session is in 2 hours
- **Anti-performative** - no streaks, no leaderboards, just presence
- **Daily reflection** - the part that actually matters, built in

---

## Tech Stack (TBD)

**Frontend:**
- React Native (iOS/Android)
- Touch Designer integration for generative visuals? (or p5.js/Three.js)
- Lottie for wireframe animations

**Backend:**
- Real-time presence (who's meditating now)
- Push notifications (synchronized global prompts)
- Simple DB: users, sessions, reflections

**Vibe:**
- Fast, minimal, no bullshit
- Works offline for solo mode
- Syncs when you're back online

## Open Questions

1. **Monetization?**
   - Free tier: join collective sessions, solo mode
   - Paid tier: custom groups (meditate with your friends), extended reflections, longer sessions?
   - Or just... free? (FOSS meditation?)

2. **Moderation?**
   - Community reflections could get dark/heavy
   - Need light-touch moderation or flagging system

3. **Privacy?**
   - Anonymous by default?
   - Optional profiles with names/photos?

4. **Guided vs. Silent?**
   - Collective sessions: silent timer only?
   - Or optional ambient soundscapes (rain, jungle, silence)?

5. **How do we onboard people who've never meditated?**
   - 3-day intro course?
   - Just... throw them in? (sink or swim, but with friends)

## Daily Focus

**This week:**
- [ ] Sketch wireframes (bone white + black lines + jungle textures)
- [ ] Design notification copy ("Join the session" vs "Meditate now" - what feels right?)
- [ ] Prototype collective session UI (pulsing circle? breathing visual? what feels alive?)

**This month:**
- [ ] Build prototype: notification → session → post-session check-in
- [ ] Test with 10 friends: does the collective vibe work?
- [ ] Refine daily reflection prompts (find the ones that hit)

**This quarter:**
- [ ] Launch private beta
- [ ] Iterate on community features
- [ ] Figure out if this is a business or a gift

## Why This Matters

Meditation apps treat practice like a chore. Streaks. Gamification. Gold stars.

But meditation isn't a chore. It's a return. A pause. A collective exhale.

Open figured out how to make "checking in" feel like connection, not performance.

We're doing the same thing, but instead of photos, it's presence.

Instead of "look at my life," it's "let's breathe together."

Simple. Daily. Real.

**Next steps:** Sketch the damn wireframes. See what this looks like.
