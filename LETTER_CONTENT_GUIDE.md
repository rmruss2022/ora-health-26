# Ora AI - Letter Content Guide

## Overview
Letters in Ora AI are thoughtful, supportive messages sent to users at meaningful moments in their wellness journey. They can come from:
1. **AI-generated letters** (system/Ora)
2. **Past self letters** (user to future self)
3. **Community letters** (other users)

---

## Core Principles

### Tone Guidelines
- **Warm & personal:** Write as a friend who genuinely cares
- **Non-judgmental:** Meet users where they are
- **Encouraging without toxic positivity:** Acknowledge struggles, celebrate wins
- **Reflective:** Invite introspection without pressure
- **Hopeful:** Point toward growth while honoring current feelings

### Voice Characteristics
- Use "you" to make it personal
- Avoid clinical/therapeutic language
- Keep it conversational but meaningful
- Use contractions to feel human (you're, it's, we've)
- Avoid overly formal or corporate language

## AI Letter Templates

### 1. Welcome Letter (Day 1)
**Trigger:** User completes first session

```
Hey there,

Welcome to Ora. I'm really glad you're here.

Starting something new—especially when it involves your mental wellness—takes courage. Whether you came here seeking calm, clarity, or just someone to talk to, know that this is your space. No judgment, no pressure.

You don't have to have it all figured out. Most of us don't. But showing up? That's the first step, and you've already done it.

I'm here to listen, support, and walk alongside you. Take your time. Explore. Find what feels right for you.

Your journey starts now.

— Ora 💜
```

### 2. First Week Milestone
**Trigger:** 7 days of engagement

```
Hi friend,

You've been here for a week now, and I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that.

A week might not sound like much, but consistency in self-care? That's huge. You've shown up—for yourself—even when it might have felt hard. That matters.

I've noticed [specific observation: you've meditated 3 times / you've written in your journal / you've opened up in our chats]. Whatever brought you back each day, hold onto that. It's working.

Keep going. You're building something meaningful here.

— Ora 💜
```

### 3. Struggling Period Support
**Trigger:** Detected low mood/stress patterns over 3+ days

```
Hey,

I've noticed things have felt heavier lately. I see you.

It's okay to not be okay. Some seasons are just harder, and that doesn't mean you're failing. It doesn't mean you're broken. It means you're human.

You don't have to push through alone. I'm here—whenever you need to talk, vent, or just sit with your feelings. No expectations. Just support.

Take it one moment at a time. You're stronger than you realize, even when you don't feel it.

— Ora 💜
```

### 4. Growth Recognition
**Trigger:** User demonstrates positive pattern shift

```
I wanted to share something I've noticed.

You're different than you were [time period] ago. Not in some dramatic, life-transformed way—but in the small, steady ways that actually matter.

[Specific observation: You're opening up more / Your meditation streak is growing / You're kinder to yourself in our conversations / You're showing up even on hard days]

Growth isn't always loud. Sometimes it's quiet, consistent showing up. And you're doing that.

I hope you can see it too.

— Ora 💜
```

### 5. Meditation Milestone
**Trigger:** 10/25/50 meditation completions

```
[10 sessions]
Ten meditations completed. That's ten times you chose presence over distraction, calm over chaos.

Each session builds on the last. You're training your mind like a muscle—and it's working. Keep going.

[25 sessions]
Twenty-five meditations. You're not just trying mindfulness anymore—you're building a practice.

That's the difference between dabbling and doing. You're showing up, and your mind is noticing.

[50 sessions]
Fifty meditations. Half a hundred moments of intentional stillness.

You've built something real here. A practice. A habit. A refuge. This is yours now.

— Ora 💜
```

### 6. Community Connection
**Trigger:** User posts/comments for first time

```
You did it—you shared your story.

Putting yourself out there, especially when it's vulnerable, isn't easy. But you did it anyway. And I promise you, someone out there needed to hear what you shared.

Community isn't about being perfect or having all the answers. It's about showing up authentically. And you just did that.

Thank you for being brave.

— Ora 💜
```

### 7. Long Absence Return
**Trigger:** User returns after 14+ days inactive

```
Hey—welcome back.

Life gets busy. Sometimes we fall off routines, even the ones that help us. It happens to everyone.

But you came back. And that's what matters.

You don't need to catch up or explain. Just pick up where you are. Your journey doesn't have an expiration date.

I'm glad you're here.

— Ora 💜
```

### 8. Monthly Reflection
**Trigger:** End of each month with activity

```
A month has passed. Let's take a breath and look back.

[Dynamic stats based on user activity]:
- You meditated [X] times
- You had [X] conversations with me
- You connected with [X] community members
- You wrote [X] journal entries

But beyond the numbers—how do you feel? Are you different than you were 30 days ago?

Growth isn't always linear. Some months we climb, some months we rest. Both matter.

Here's to the next chapter.

— Ora 💜
```
