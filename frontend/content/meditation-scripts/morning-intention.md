# Morning Intention Meditation (3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Set a positive intention for the day ahead

---

Good morning. Welcome. [pause 2s]

Find a comfortable seat, your spine tall but relaxed. [pause 3s]

Let your eyes close softly. [pause 2s]

---

Take a deep breath in through your nose... [pause 2s]

And exhale fully through your mouth. [pause 3s]

One more time. [pause 1s]

Breathe in fresh energy... [pause 2s]

Release any lingering sleep or tension. [pause 4s]

---

This is your day. [pause 2s]

Full of possibility. [pause 3s]

Take a moment to ask yourself: [pause 2s]

How do I want to feel today? [pause 4s]

---

Perhaps you want to feel: [pause 1s]

Calm. [pause 2s]

Focused. [pause 2s]

Joyful. [pause 2s]

Connected. [pause 3s]

---

Choose one word that resonates. [pause 3s]

This is your intention. [pause 3s]

---

Breathe into this feeling. [pause 3s]

Imagine yourself moving through your day with this quality. [pause 4s]

See yourself carrying it with you. [pause 3s]

---

What's one small action you can take to honor this intention? [pause 4s]

Perhaps it's: [pause 1s]

Taking a moment to pause when you feel rushed. [pause 2s]

Smiling at a stranger. [pause 2s]

Saying something kind to yourself. [pause 3s]

---

Whatever it is, hold it gently in your awareness. [pause 3s]

---

Place one hand on your heart. [pause 2s]

Feel its steady rhythm. [pause 3s]

Silently say to yourself: [pause 2s]

"Today, I choose [your word]." [pause 4s]

---

Take one more deep breath. [pause 3s]

---

When you're ready, open your eyes. [pause 2s]

Notice the light around you. [pause 2s]

This is your fresh start. [pause 2s]

Go forward with intention. [pause 2s]
