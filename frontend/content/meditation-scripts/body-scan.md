**Purpose**: Progressive relaxation through body awareness

---

Welcome to this body scan meditation. [pause 2s]

Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. [pause 3s]

Gently close your eyes, or soften your gaze. [pause 2s]

Take a deep breath in... [pause 2s] and slowly release. [pause 3s]

---

Let's begin by bringing awareness to your feet. [pause 2s]

Notice any sensations in your toes, the soles of your feet, your heels. [pause 3s]

Without judging, simply observe. [pause 3s]

Now, imagine a warm, golden light flowing into your feet... [pause 2s]

Softening any tension you find there. [pause 4s]

---

Bring your attention up to your lower legs. [pause 2s]

Notice your calves, your shins, your ankles. [pause 3s]

Allow the golden light to flow upward... [pause 2s]

Releasing any tightness as it moves. [pause 4s]

---

Move your awareness to your knees and thighs. [pause 3s]

Notice the weight of your legs. [pause 2s]

Are they heavy? Light? Tingling? [pause 3s]

Let the warmth continue to rise, softening your muscles. [pause 4s]

---

Now bring attention to your hips and lower back. [pause 3s]

This area often holds tension. [pause 2s]

With each breath, imagine that tension melting away. [pause 4s]

The golden light continues upward, warm and soothing. [pause 3s]

---

Notice your belly and chest. [pause 2s]

Feel your breath naturally rising and falling. [pause 3s]

No need to change it. Simply observe. [pause 3s]

Let your torso soften with each exhale. [pause 4s]

---

Bring awareness to your shoulders. [pause 2s]

Are they up near your ears? [pause 2s]

Gently let them drop. [pause 3s]

Feel the weight of your arms. [pause 2s]

Let them rest completely. [pause 4s]

---

Notice your hands. [pause 2s]

Your fingers, your palms. [pause 3s]

Release any gripping or tension. [pause 3s]

Let the warmth fill your hands completely. [pause 4s]

---

Now bring attention to your neck. [pause 2s]

Notice your throat, the back of your neck. [pause 3s]

Allow these muscles to soften. [pause 3s]

---

Notice your jaw. [pause 2s]

Let it release. [pause 2s]

Soften your tongue. [pause 2s]

Relax your face. [pause 3s]

Your forehead smooth and open. [pause 3s]

---

Take one more moment to scan your entire body. [pause 3s]

From the crown of your head to the tips of your toes. [pause 4s]

Notice how you feel. [pause 3s]

---

When you're ready... [pause 2s]

Begin to deepen your breath. [pause 3s]

Gently wiggle your fingers and toes. [pause 3s]

And slowly open your eyes. [pause 2s]

---

Thank you for taking this time for yourself. [pause 2s]

Carry this sense of ease with you. [pause 2s]
